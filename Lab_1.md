# Explore the Azure Machine Learning Workspace

Azure Machine Learning offers a robust platform for data science, enabling users to train and manage machine learning models efficiently. This lab serves as an introductory exploration into the Azure Machine Learning workspace, highlighting its core capabilities and the developer tools available. For those interested in a deeper understanding of these capabilities, additional labs are available for further exploration.

## Before You Start

- **Prerequisite**: Ensure you have an Azure subscription with administrative-level access.
- **Azure CLI with Azure Machine Learning Extension**: Ideal for automating infrastructure tasks through command-line instructions.
- **Azure Machine Learning Studio**: Offers a user-friendly interface for exploring workspace capabilities.
- **Python SDK for Azure Machine Learning**: Best suited for data scientists looking to submit jobs and manage models via Jupyter notebooks.

## Provisioning an Azure Machine Learning Workspace

The Azure Machine Learning workspace acts as a central hub for all resources and assets needed for model training and management. It can be provisioned through the Azure portal's interactive interface or via the Azure CLI, enhanced with the Azure Machine Learning extension. Automating provisioning through the CLI is recommended in production scenarios for integration into a DevOps workflow.

![Alt text](.img\1\10.png)

2. Close any pop-ups that may appear in the studio.

## Navigating the Studio

1. Observe the various pages displayed on the left side of the studio. If you see only symbols, click the â˜° icon to expand the menu and reveal the names of the pages.
2. Explore the **Authoring** section, which includes:
   - Notebooks
   - Automated ML
   - Designer
   
   These tools provide three distinct methods for creating your own machine learning models within the studio.

3. Examine the **Assets** section, encompassing:
   - Data
   - Jobs
   - Models
   
   Assets can be either utilized or generated during the training or scoring of a model. They serve to train, deploy, and manage your models, and can be versioned for historical tracking.

4. Review the **Manage** section, which includes Compute among other resources. These are essential infrastructural components required for training or deploying a machine learning model.

# Authoring a Training Pipeline

Exploring asset and resource use within the Azure Machine Learning workspace can be achieved by training a model. The Designer offers a straightforward method to author a model training pipeline.

> **Note:** Throughout your time in the studio, pop-ups may appear to guide you. These can be closed and ignored to focus on the lab instructions.

## Using the Designer

1. Navigate to the **Designer** page via the menu on the left side of the studio.

![Alt text](.img\1\12.png)

2. Select the **Regression - Automobile Price Prediction (Basic)** sample.

![Alt text](.img\1\13.png)

This action generates a new pipeline. Initially, a component loads raw automobile price data. Subsequently, the pipeline processes this data and employs a linear regression model to forecast prices for each automobile.

## Configuring and Submitting the Pipeline

1. Click **Configure & Submit** at the top of the page to initiate the *Set up pipeline job* dialogue.

![Alt text](.img\1\14.png)

2. On the **Basics** page, opt to **Create new** and designate the experiment's name as `train-regression-designer`, then click **Next**.

![Alt text](.img\1\15.png)

3. Proceed to **Next** on the **Inputs & outputs** page without altering any settings.

![Alt text](.img\1\16.png)

4. Upon reaching the **Runtime settings** page, you might encounter an error due to the absence of a default compute required to execute the pipeline.

# Creating a Compute Target

To execute any workload in the Azure Machine Learning workspace, a compute resource is essential. Azure Machine Learning enables the creation of cloud-based compute resources, allowing for scalable experiments and training scripts.

## Steps to Create a Compute Target

In the Azure Machine Learning studio:

1. Navigate to the **Compute** page via the menu on the left side.

![Alt text](.img\1\18.png)


### Types of Compute Resources

Azure Machine Learning supports four types of compute resources:

- **Compute Instances:** Managed virtual machines perfect for development phases, data exploration, and model experimentation.
- **Compute Clusters:** Scalable clusters of virtual machines designed for on-demand experiment code processing, suitable for production or automated jobs.
- **Kubernetes Clusters:** Utilized for training and scoring, these clusters are ideal for large-scale, real-time model deployment.
- **Attached Compute:** Allows for the attachment of existing Azure compute resources, like Virtual Machines or Azure Databricks clusters, to the workspace.

### Provisioning a Compute Instance or Cluster

For training a model using the Designer, select either a compute instance or cluster:

1. Go to the **Compute instances** tab.

2. Add a new compute instance with the following configurations:
   - **Compute Name:** Enter a unique identifier.
   - **Location:** Set automatically to match your workspace.
   - **Virtual Machine Type:** CPU
   - **Virtual Machine Size:** Standard_DS11_v2
   - **Available Quota:** Shows the number of dedicated cores available.
   - **Show Advanced Settings:** Observe but do not select the following options:
     - **Enable SSH Access:** Leave unselected unless you need SSH client access to the VM.
     - **Enable Virtual Network:** Typically unselected unless required for enhanced network security in an enterprise setting.
     - **Assign to Another User:** Unselected, unless assigning a compute instance to a specific data scientist.
     - **Provision with Setup Script:** Unselected, but useful for running a script on the remote instance upon creation.
     - **Assign a Managed Identity:** Unselected, but available for attaching system assigned or user assigned managed identities to access resources.
