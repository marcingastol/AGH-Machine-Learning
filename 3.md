# Training a Model with Azure Machine Learning Designer

The Azure Machine Learning Designer offers a user-friendly, drag-and-drop interface that simplifies the process of creating workflows for training models. This tool is particularly useful for testing and comparing different algorithms without the need for extensive coding.

## Steps to Train and Compare Classification Algorithms

### Setting Up a New Pipeline

1. **Access Azure Machine Learning Workspace**:
   - Go to the Azure portal and locate your Azure Machine Learning workspace.
   - Click on **Launch studio** from the workspace's Overview page to open Azure Machine Learning Studio in a new browser tab.
   - Close any introductory pop-ups that might appear in the studio.

2. **Verify Compute Cluster**:
   - On the Azure Machine Learning studio, head to the **Compute** page to ensure the compute cluster created previously is present and idle, showing 0 nodes running.

3. **Initiate a Training Pipeline with the Designer**:
   - Navigate to the **Designer** page within the studio.
   - Click on the **Custom** tab located at the top of the page.
   - Opt to create a new empty pipeline using the custom components option.
   - Rename the default pipeline name from `Pipeline-Created-on-date` to `Train-Diabetes-Classifier` by clicking the pencil icon next to the name.

By following these steps, you set the stage for leveraging the Azure Machine Learning Designer to efficiently train and evaluate multiple classification algorithms, significantly streamlining the model development process.

# Creating a New Pipeline in Azure Machine Learning

Training a model efficiently requires structured data. Azure Machine Learning allows the use of data from various sources, including datastores or public URLs, to be integrated into your machine learning pipeline.

## Steps to Create a Pipeline

### Setting Up Data

1. **Accessing Data**:
   - From the left menu, click on the **Data** tab.
   - Locate and drag the `diabetes-folder` component onto the canvas, preparing your dataset for the pipeline.

### Building the Pipeline

2. **Adding Components**:
   - Switch to the **Components** tab from the left menu.
   - To preprocess the data, drag the `Remove Empty Rows` component onto the canvas, positioning it beneath the `diabetes-folder`.
   - Create a connection from the diabetes data component to the `Remove Empty Rows` component.
   - Continue the pipeline by adding the `Normalize Numerical Columns` component below and connecting it to the `Remove Empty Rows` component.
   - Finalize the data preparation by adding the `Train a Decision Tree Classifier Model` component, linking it to the normalization component.

### Configuring and Launching the Pipeline

3. **Launching the Pipeline**:
   - Click **Configure & Submit** to access the pipeline job setup.
   - Initiate a new experiment named `diabetes-designer-pipeline` and proceed by clicking **Next**, without making changes to the Inputs & Outputs.
   - For **Runtime settings**, select `Compute Cluster` and choose your `aml-cluster` from the dropdown.
   - Review the setup and then submit to commence the pipeline execution.

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

- Monitor the pipeline's progress through the **Pipelines** page by selecting the `Train-Diabetes-Classifier` pipeline.
- The initialization of the compute cluster might delay the start as it scales from 0 nodes. Once operational, the pipeline will execute automatically.
- Track the execution of each component within the pipeline. Should any component fail, the **Outputs + logs** tab in the job overview will offer insights and error messages to diagnose the issue.

This comprehensive approach facilitates not only the creation and execution of a machine learning pipeline but also provides mechanisms to monitor and troubleshoot the process, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of model training.

# Training a Second Model for Comparison

Comparing different machine learning algorithms is essential for evaluating their performance. Azure Machine Learning Designer enables the training of multiple models within a single pipeline for direct comparison.

## Steps to Train and Compare Two Models

### Preparing the Pipeline

1. **Access the Designer**:
   - Navigate back to the **Designer** and open the `Train-Diabetes-Classifier` pipeline draft.

2. **Adding a New Model**:
   - Incorporate the `Train a Logistic Regression Classifier Model` component onto the canvas, positioning it alongside the existing training component.
   - Connect the `Normalize Numerical Columns` component's output to the input of the logistic regression training component.

### Configuring and Launching the Comparison

3. **Pipeline Configuration**:
   - Click on **Configure & Submit** to start the setup for the pipeline run.
   - On the **Basics** page, initiate a new experiment titled `designer-compare-classification`, and proceed.

4. **Executing the Pipeline**:
   - After reviewing, submit the pipeline to begin the training process.
   - Track the pipeline's status by visiting the **Pipelines** page and selecting the `Train-Diabetes-Classifier` pipeline associated with the `designer-compare-classification` experiment.

### Evaluating the Models

- Once all components have completed running, navigate to the **Job overview**.
- Review the performance metrics of both training components under the **Metrics** tab.
- Assess which model demonstrates better performance based on the metrics provided.

By training and comparing two models within the same pipeline, you can make informed decisions about which algorithm better suits your data and project goals.
