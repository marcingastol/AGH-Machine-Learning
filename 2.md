# Explore Developer Tools for Workspace Interaction

This lab introduces the various developer tools available for interacting with the Azure Machine Learning workspace. Whether you're performing tasks or have a preference for specific developer tools, this guide will help you select the right tool for the job. For in-depth learning on a particular tool, additional labs are available.

# Configuring Your Workstation with Azure Machine Learning Studio

While the Azure CLI is a powerful tool for automation, you may occasionally need to visually verify the outcomes of your commands. Azure Machine Learning Studio provides a graphical interface to check the creation of resources and assets, as well as to assess the success or failure of jobs.

## Steps to Use Azure Machine Learning Studio

1. **Accessing Azure Machine Learning Workspace**:
   - Go to the Azure portal and find the Azure Machine Learning workspace named `mlw-dp100-labs`.

2. **Launching Azure Machine Learning Studio**:
   - Within the workspace's Overview page, click on **Launch studio**. This action will open a new tab in your browser, directing you to Azure Machine Learning Studio.
   - Close any introductory pop-ups that may appear.

3. **Verifying Compute Resources**:
   - In Azure Machine Learning Studio, navigate to the **Compute** page.
   - Confirm the presence and status of the compute instance and cluster created in previous steps. The compute instance should be marked as running, while the cluster should be idle, displaying 0 nodes in operation.

This process ensures that your workstation is properly configured to interact with Azure Machine Learning Studio, allowing for a seamless blend of command-line and graphical management of your machine learning resources.

# Using the Python SDK to Train a Model

After ensuring the necessary compute resources are in place, the next step involves utilizing the Python SDK for Azure Machine Learning to execute a training script. This script will be run on the compute instance and target the compute cluster for the actual model training.

## Steps for Model Training with Python SDK

1. **Accessing the Compute Instance Terminal**:
   - Open the Terminal application on your compute instance to launch the command line interface.

2. **Installing the Python SDK**:
   - Execute the following commands in the terminal to install or update the Python SDK:
     ```
     pip uninstall azure-ai-ml
     pip install azure-ai-ml
     ```
   - Disregard any error messages indicating the packages were not previously installed.

3. **Cloning the Required Repository**:
   - Clone a Git repository containing essential notebooks, data, and files to your workspace with:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-azure-ml.git azure-ml-labs
     ```
   - Refresh the Files pane post-cloning to confirm the creation of a new folder named `Users/your-user-name/azure-ml-labs`.

4. **Executing the Training Notebook**:
   - Navigate to and open the `Labs/02/Run training script.ipynb` notebook.
   - Authenticate your session if prompted.
   - Ensure the notebook is set to use the `Python 3.8 - AzureML` kernel, equipped with a pre-installed packages set.
   - Run all cells within the notebook to initiate the model training process.

### Training Job Execution

Upon running the notebook, a new job is submitted to the Azure Machine Learning workspace. This job meticulously tracks all configurations, code, and outputs, such as performance metrics, providing a comprehensive overview of the model training process.

# Reviewing Your Job History in Azure Machine Learning Studio

After submitting a job to the Azure Machine Learning workspace, Azure Machine Learning Studio offers a platform to monitor and review the job's progress and outcomes.

## How to Review Job Status

1. **Accessing Job Information**:
   - Follow the job URL outputted by the notebook directly to the job's page.
   - Alternatively, manually navigate to the **Jobs** page within Azure Machine Learning Studio.

2. **Locating Your Experiment**:
   - Find the experiment titled `diabetes-training` and select the most recent job, `diabetes-pythonv2-train`.

3. **Understanding Job Properties**:
   - **Status Indicators**:
     - **Queued**: Awaiting available compute resources.
     - **Preparing**: The compute cluster is scaling or the compute target is being prepared.
     - **Running**: The training script is currently executing.
     - **Finalizing**: The script has executed, and the job is consolidating final details.
     - **Completed**: The job has successfully concluded and terminated.
     - **Failed**: The job did not complete successfully and has been terminated.

4. **Reviewing Outputs and Logs**:
   - The **Outputs + logs** section houses the `user_logs/std_log.txt`, which includes script outputs and, if applicable, error messages pinpointing script issues.

5. **Inspecting Code**:
   - Under the **Code** tab, you can review the directory specified in the job configuration, containing the training script and dataset.

Utilizing Azure Machine Learning Studio to review job histories not only allows for real-time status updates but also aids in troubleshooting and optimizing machine learning workflows by providing detailed logs and output information.
